-   üìÇ Organize videos by course in a clean directory structure
-   üéØ Selective lesson downloading
-   üõ†Ô∏è Robust error handling and retry mechanisms

## Requirements

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
-   **yt-dlp** - Download the executable from [yt-dlp's GitHub repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and place it in the `bin` folder

## Installation

### Local Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vuesch-dl.git
cd vuesch-dl
npm install
```

### Global Installation

To install the tool globally and use it from anywhere, run:

```bash
npm install -g ./
```

This will make the `vuesch-dl` command available globally.

## Usage

```bash
vuesch-dl [courseUrl] [options]
```

### Options

-   `-e, --email <email>` - Your Vue School email
-   `-p, --password <password>` - Your Vue School password
-   `-d, --directory <directory>` - Directory to save videos (default: `./downloads`)
-   `-a, --all` - Download all available courses
-   `-f, --force` - Force download even if course exists

## Examples

### Download a specific course

```bash
vuesch-dl https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals -e your@email.com -p yourpassword
```

### Download all courses

```bash
vuesch-dl -a -e your@email.com -p yourpassword
```

### Specify a custom download directory

```bash
vuesch-dl https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals -e your@email.com -p yourpassword -d ./my-courses
```

### Force re-download of a course

```bash
vuesch-dl https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals -e your@email.com -p yourpassword -f
```

## How It Works

This tool uses Puppeteer to authenticate with Vue School and navigate through course pages. It then extracts video URLs and uses yt-dlp to download the videos in 720p (hardcoded for smaller file sizes, but can be modified in the code for different quality settings).

The downloader automatically organizes videos by course and numbers them sequentially. The implementation downloads video and audio streams separately as that's the format in which the content is available. The tool also supports resuming interrupted downloads and will only download missing or incomplete files when restarted.

### Automatic Recovery for Missing Videos

The tool now automatically checks for missing or incomplete files after downloading a course and attempts to redownload them:

1. After a course download completes, the system verifies all lessons
2. Any missing or incomplete files are automatically detected
3. The tool will retry downloading these files without manual intervention
4. If you still want to force a complete redownload of all lessons in a course, use the `-f` flag:
    ```bash
    vuesch-dl https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals -e your@email.com -p yourpassword -f
    ```

### Video and Audio Merger

This tool now includes a powerful video merger utility that automatically combines the separate video and audio files downloaded from Vue School into high-quality MP4 files:

-   Automatically merges video and audio streams into a single file
-   Supports batch processing of entire courses
-   Provides options to keep or delete original files after merging
-   Requires Python 3.6+ and FFmpeg

For detailed instructions on using the video merger tool, please refer to the [Video Merger Documentation](./README_VIDEO_MERGER.md).
